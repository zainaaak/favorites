     <p> Zaina loves Brooklyn 99 because of Jake Peralta. Jake Peralta is an extremly funny, 
      good looking and intelligent young detective, with whom Zaina resonates. 
      Brooklyn 99 is a comfort show for her because it helps her destress 
      and just not use her brain for a few hours.She aslos love watching tv shhows,
      espacially sitcoms becuase of how relaxing and constant they are.

        <p>Zaina thinks that shopping when you actually have money is one of the most
         enjoyable things to do because it just make you feel like you are on top 
         of the world and you just get to enjoy yourself so much more, but she only
          likes shopping when she is alone.

        Zaina loves swimming so much necuase it allows her to have some peace of mind.
         since during the times tht she is swimming tshe doesnt need to worry about 
         anything else exept for trying not to drown andtrake as many laps as she 
         possibly can. its also a fun and efficient way of getting you excersize in.
